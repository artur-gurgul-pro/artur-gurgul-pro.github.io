          I worked there on a very interesting and innovative project which aims at EV drivers. My main responsibility was to create new features and fix bugs. The app oryginalny has been written in Objective-C using UIKit. I improved the architecture and introduced SwiftUI and Combine Framework. Moreover I was involved in research and I often took part in “brain storm” regarding user experience. I also created a small internal project for booking parking spots. When I started a job here we used a spreadsheet for it. Me and a colleague came up with the idea for a mobile app. In this project I designed the API and implemented it using Node Js running in the Azure environment.
