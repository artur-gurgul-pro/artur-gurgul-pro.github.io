Squash the last three commits

```bash
git rebase -i HEAD~3
```

You will see something like this

```plain
pick f392171 Added new feature X
pick ba9dd9a Added new elements to page design
pick df71a27 Updated CSS for new elements
```

- `pick` `p` the commit will be taken
- `squash` `s`, the commit will be blended with the above.

Edit to something like this

```plain
pick f392171 New message for this three commit!
squash ba9dd9a
squash df71a27
```

Now you can accept the change by continuing the rebase:

```bash
git rebase --continue
```

After that you need to force override the history using this command:

```bash
git push origin master --force
```

## Squash merge

```bash
git checkout master
git merge --squash bugfix
git commit
```
